### Boards Menu
The boards page in Trello is the central hub where users can create and manage multiple boards, each representing a project or task. It provides a visual and intuitive interface for organizing and tracking progress. Users can create lists within boards to represent different stages or categories, and within each list, they can create cards to represent specific tasks or items. These cards can be assigned to team members, have due dates, and contain additional details, such as descriptions, checklists, attachments, and comments. The boards page in Trello enables efficient project management, collaboration, and task tracking.
